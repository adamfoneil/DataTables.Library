Most of the time I use Dapper (in some form or another, mainly through my [Postulate](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Postulate) library) for all data access. Sometimes, I need to use ADO.NET DataTables for really dynamic things. The syntax for querying DataTables isn't terribly convenient, so that's why this library exists.

Nuget package: **AdoUtil.Library**
